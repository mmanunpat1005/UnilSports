# UnilSports

A project for the Programming Tools in Data Science course, the Autumn 2022 semester.

The `UnilSports` makes it easier for UNIL/EPFL users or people interested in the activities of the University of Lausanne Sports Center to find their preferred sport more efficiently and to have an estimate of calorie burn.

## Disclaimer 

With this package the user will be able to visualize in a dashboard the daily exercise recommendation plan based on the user's preference. To obtain a recommendation, users will be required to fill in some information about themselves such as the following: 

* The number of calories that users would like to burn out per day.
* A preferable time slot that users would like to workout in. 
* Preferable sport activities. Similar to the preferable time slot, users can select multiple sport activities from a dropdown list of the classes provided.
* User's weight. This is needed to calculate the number of calories burned.
